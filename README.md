# c-review-and-data-structures
This repository contains codes which might seem complex and there are other possible solutions. It is intended for audience with prior C-programming knowledge and started to learn Data Structures. Many concepts are used while coding. Documentation is not provided. Hope, this is readable to you! Good Luck!

I am grateful to my teacher, Dr. Mumit Khan. I have taken the sequence of topics from my undergrad courses (which were taught in Java). Let's C, if I can code some C too!
