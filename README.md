# programming-data-structures-algorithms
This repository contains codes which might seem complex to newbie and there are other possible solutions. It is intended for audience with both experienced(data-structures-classroom-codes) and newbie(c-programming-classroom-codes) with C-programming knowledge and started to learn Data Structures. Many concepts are used while coding. Documentation is not provided. Hope, this is readable to you! Good Luck!

I am grateful to my teacher, Professor Dr. Mumit Khan. I have taken the sequence of topics from my undergrad courses (which were taught in Java). 
Let's C, if I can code some C too!

# Algorithms codes

## This repository contains some of the algorithms implementation in any one of the following languages:

C
C++
Java
Python
These are some policies I followed:

File name is self-explanatory.
Any explanation of the implementation is provided as comments.
Time/Space Complexity is provided for some codes.
### The list of codes/algorithms is incomplete... Go directly to the folder to find codes.
